# ♻️ Smart Garbage Separation App

A deep learning-based web app that classifies uploaded waste images into categories like **cardboard**, **glass**, **metal**, **paper**, **plastic**, or **trash**. This tool promotes effective waste management and supports sustainability initiatives.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload waste images from your device or via a URL
- Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on multiple garbage classes
- Instant classification into one of 6 waste types
- Built with **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **Streamlit**, and **Pillow**
- User-friendly interface with real-time feedback

## 🖼️ Garbage Classes

The model is trained to identify:

- 📦 Cardboard  
- 🍾 Glass  
- 🥫 Metal  
- 📄 Paper  
- 🧴 Plastic  
- 🚮 Trash

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/garbage-separation-app.git
cd garbage-separation-app/Deployment
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

Create a virtual environment (optional) and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download the model weights:**

Make sure `modelnew.h5` is either in the `weights/` folder or update the script to download it from Google Drive or another URL.

4. **Run the Streamlit app:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
